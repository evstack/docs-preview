Many developers are starting to imagine what the future of sovereign rollups could look like on Bitcoin and other data availability layers. They’re looking for ways to innovate using this integration, to replicate it on other layer 1 blockchains, to identify challenges and to suggest improvements.</p><p>We believe that there’s a lot of innovation to be done and a lot of challenges to be solved, and that together as a community, we can collaborate on building the future of rollup frameworks.</p><p>That’s why we’re happy to announce that we’re launching a Rollkit’s community call: Let’s Roll.</p><h2 id="tl-dr" tabindex="-1">TL;DR <a class="header-anchor" href="#tl-dr" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;TL;DR&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><p>Rollkit is launching its community call, Let’s Roll.

Rollkit is at the forefront of the rollup movement offering a modular framework for rollups as an open-source public good.</p><p>However, Rollkit&#39;s true potential lies in its community of developers and users who bring their unique perspectives, skills, and expertise to the table. When Rollkit integrates a new data availability layer, its community members are best suited to improve this integration and use it in ways that truly benefit the community. Therefore, we invite developers from different communities and skill sets to join us and contribute to Rollkit’s development.</p><p>By contributing to Rollkit, we reduce fragmentation, duplicated features and bugs, and we ensure the continuous improvement of Rollkit. By doing that we forge a stronger and bigger community.</p><p>One framework is bigger than the sum of all its forks. Together we can build something for all developers and builders to easily use.</p><p>Our promise, as core contributors, is to do our best to make “just merge it” a reality. We strive to empower developers to contribute to Rollkit and ensure that their contributions are integrated.</p><p>That&#39;s why we believe it&#39;s time to bring our community together to share knowledge, collaborate on new ideas, and inspire each other to push the limits of what&#39;s possible with Rollkit.</p><h2 id="what-is-let-s-roll" tabindex="-1">What is Let’s Roll? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-let-s-roll" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is Let’s Roll?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Let&#39;s Roll is a dynamic community-focused meeting that brings together all Rollkit’s contributors to drive the innovation and development of Rollkit.</p><p>This meeting serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, discussing the latest updates, and exploring new ideas. Rollkit&#39;s contributors will demonstrate the most recent features and advancements, while community members will have the chance to ask questions, provide feedback, and collaborate on new projects.</p><p>Building open source means encouraging collaboration and teamwork among all developers. Sharing code and ideas will help us build a better framework more efficiently.</p><p>The meeting will be hosted on <a href="https://us06web.zoom.us/j/83308619122" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zoom</a>.
